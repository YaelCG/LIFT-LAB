# LIFT-LAB

Welcome to the GitHub interface!!!

## Task 1: Make a Github account

To have a share repository for all MIT LIFT-Lab projects, we will be using GitHub.

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that helps developers store, manage, and share code. It is built around Git, a version control system that tracks changes to files and allows multiple people to collaborate on projects without overwriting each otherâ€™s work. GitHub provides tools for version control, issue tracking, and collaboration, making it an essential platform for software development. In our case, and as out team is expanding, now multiple people can see other people's work 

It is widely used for hosting open-source projects and private repositories, and it integrates with various tools for automation, continuous integration, and deployment. Features like pull requests, code reviews, and project management tools make GitHub a central hub for software development teams.
